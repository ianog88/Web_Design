# Web Design
This respository contains a sample html file ([test.html](test.html)) which is intended to illustrate my grasp of basic web design. The source code can be downloaded and opened in a browser to view the web page. I omited the use of CSS to make it easy to view and hence I was limited with regard to the aesthetic design of the web page. The corresponding modules are:
- [Visual Design & User Experience (WBDB H1002)](https://www.tudublin.ie/study/modules/wbdb-h1002-visual-design--user-experience/)
- [Client-Side Web Development (WEBD H2001)](https://www.tudublin.ie/study/modules/webd-h2001-client-side-web-development/)
- [Server-Side Web Development (WEBD H3001)](https://www.tudublin.ie/study/modules/webd-h3001-server-side-web-development/)
