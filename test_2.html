        <p>This webpage outlines my full programming journey from 2019 to present. It outlines the experience in programming and statistical modelling I acquired through my time spent trading the financial markets. It includes each programming language I have learnt as well as the various computer science and machine learning topics.</p>

        <h2 id="section1">2019</h2>
        <p>I was first introduced to programming in UCD while studying mathematics, in which I learnt R and Python. In September, I began saving money in order to trade the financial markets with the goal of making enough to trade full time.</p>

        <h2 id="section2">2020</h2>
        <p>In order to test trading strategies, I starting writing backtesting engines in python. As there were no good backtesting libraries available I built everything from scratch. By March, I had a barebones statistical arbitrage strategy which I began trading manually (the program would output the suggested stocks and quantities and I would place the orders myself). The basic strategy was buy/sell the stocks with the highest relative movement, forecasting a reversion to the mean. The movement was measured as the residual after regressing the stock onto the market index (S&P) using a rolling 100-day window. I used stock options instead of stocks in order to gain leverage as I needed a high rate of return in order to compound my small amount of capital into anything significant (I started trading with approximately €3,000). By summer my returns were relatively flat but after analysing my returns I noticed that the long trades were significantly profitable while the short trades were not. I then decided to exclusively trade long using credit spreads to hedge my downside risk, which is when my system began to become profitable.</p>

        <h2 id="section3">2021</h2>
        <p>Towards the end of 2020 I began to look into automated trading for two reasons. Firstly as I was I was exclusively trading US stocks which trade from 2:30pm to 9:00pm Irish time, I struggling to keep up as it meant having my phone and laptop on me during these hours. Secondly, the speed of my trading was effecting my returns. My original software was very slow and manually executed the trades was compounding the problem. 

        I began by studying computer networking and API architectures. I used the book “Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach” as my guide. I found that I was using the HTTP connection to get the current prices which was significantly slower than the alternative TCP connection offered by my broker which is more much suitable for streaming data via the continuous connection. 

        I then studied the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course to get a better idea of how computers work. As a by-product of this course I was introduced to data structures, algorithms, web design, SQL (which I immediately began using to store price data for my backtests) and C programming. However, the section on memory was the most relevant and started my study of computer architecture. Geared with a new understanding of how computer programs are executed, I began using multithreading to increase the efficiency of my program. 

        By the end of the spring term my automated trading system was running and profitable. Unknown to me, my long only leveraged system was significantly outperforming due to the presence of one of the strongest bull markets in US history (in 2021 the S&P returned +28% compared to it’s +10% average). My inflated returns gave me a false sense of security and I decided to withdraw from my mathematics undergraduate. I believed my system would continue to produce the returns it had produced thus far and hence I would soon have enough to trade full time.</p>

        <h2 id="section4">2022</h2>
        <p>The US market immediately began to decline in 2022. My unhedged portfolio suffered such severe losses in January and February that I was forced to halt trading. I immediately realised based off historical tests that the past 18 months were an anomaly for long only trading and decided to revert back to the long short strategy I originally designed. However, this strategy also immediately lost money. After further analysis I found that my core statistical model was biased. I made the assumption that price behaviour is independent of time or at least to the degree that it can be ignored in the modelling process. However, when I tested for influential days I found that a small number of days were significantly influencing the model parameters and worse still, when these days were removed the strategy was no longer profitable on historical data. The system was also suffering from wide spreads on the option contracts. Option contracts are traded relatively thinly and I noticed my system was regularly paying 5/6% for the spread, significantly eating into to any profits. I began learning C++ with the hope that the additional latency would help as well as rewriting the system to trade stocks instead of stock options. However by mid-summer, with roughly €10,000 left, I realised even if I could achieve a +20% yearly return it would not be enough.

        This time was definitely a low point as I had failed at trading and also felt I had blundered my chance at academics and hence a data related job. However, I found out about RPL and potential opportunities for mature students and turned my focus towards this. I enrolled in a Professional Certificate in Data Analysis and began to study machine learning.</p>

        <h2 id="section5">2023</h2>
        <p>After completing my Certificate in Data Analysis, I completed courses in Mathematics for Machine Learning and Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Specialisation. In April, I applied through Springboard for Qualifi’s Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science. I was accepted after providing code samples and an interview.</p>

        <h2 id="section6">2024</h2>
        <p>After recently completing my Diploma in Data Science, I am very keen to continue my education and hopefully be able to get a data/finance related job. I’m looking to gain a more formal recognition of the programming skills I have acquired as well as continue to develop new skills. After throughly analysing the modules for the BSc in Computing with ML/AI course I believe it would be the ideal next step for me. While I have significant experience in deep learning and reinforcement learning I would love to cover them in a formal setting. In addition to the time spent studying the fundamentals of computer science, I have gained signifcant skills with hands-on experience.</p>
